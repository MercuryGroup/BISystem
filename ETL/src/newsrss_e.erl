%%% Server extract module for extracting stock market news.
%%% Currently supporting Yahoo Finance News RSS Feed, but can be developed
%%% to be generic. And is adapted to only retrieve the news for
%%% the current retrival date.
%%%
%%% Supports XML element filtering, and parsing of date & time strings.
%%% All the retrieved data is sent to the Load part (DB) of the ETL.
%%% NOTE: In order to retrieve news for stock market indexes there needs to be
%%% a "^" character added before the symbol name, needed in order to follow
%%% the Yahoo Finance News RSS Feed API.
